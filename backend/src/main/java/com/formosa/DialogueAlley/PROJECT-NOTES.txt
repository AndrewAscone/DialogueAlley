ENTITY TESTING on POSTMAN:

Profile - all CRUD functions
Hashtag - (PUT error, but nbd?)
chatThread - all CRUD functions (except for testing Update/Put/Edit, should not need to ever update)
Post - can't create posts, can't associate post to profile without user login set up
Xref - can't test CRUD because can't point to Post

TABLE TESTING on WORKBENCH (hard code)
profile - all crud works
hashtag - all crud works, can be edited
chatThread - all works, shouldn't need to edit
post - all crud works, can't view assoc_profile & chatThread, & userPosts list
xref - all crud works
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO LIST:
1. Create User Login > to create Post (to associate) > test Xref
    * requires front end early?
    * validate relationship annotations?
    * DTO? Data Transfer Object?

Problem:
Post Entity > POST (CREATE funct) > DATE needs to be NOTNULL
    * So on front end, create dateGetting method before sending post to save
    * do not need to write out id. "id" = 1,

Problem:
Reloading spring boot app re-adds assoc_profile_id & thread id. re-creates foreign keys
    * its fine it we don't use them/assoc them?

2. Create custom SQL queries in Repos for "filtering by" handle & hashtag

3. Build front end

4. Add images

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATABASE "HARD CODE" EDITS:

*checked NOTNULL, change "DATETIME" (NOT DATETIME(6), add CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
* manually delete assoc_profile_id & assoc_thread_id from Post table
    - doing this removes the two foreign keys that aren't needed anymore
    - assoc_profile & assoc_thread DOES still exist, just not visible
* WARNING: DELETING IT(from Postman) BREAKS 'POST/ADD'
