# DialogueAlley

Dialogue Alley is a new Twitter-style social media platform. If you’re not a user, you can still view the posts. On creating an account, users can still see the main feed of posts, but can now join the conversation! Users with an account can make posts limited to 255 characters that can include images, tagging other users, as well as hashtags to make your posts part of the greater conversation on a topic.  Posts can be searched for by hashtags or by a specific user. 

The back-end of the application is built using Spring Boot and Java. It handles all the server-side functionality, such as storing user data in a database, handling authentication and authorization, and providing a REST API for the front-end to consume.

The front-end of the application is built using React. It allows users to create an account, log in, and post short messages (similar to tweets). The front-end also displays a feed of all the messages posted by the users.

One exciting feature of Dialogue Alley is that it allows users to engage in real-time conversations with each other. Users posts appear instantly on the user’s feed without the need to refresh the page. This is achieved using WebSockets and the Spring WebSocket module.

Another exciting feature of Dialogue Alley is that it has a robust search function. Users can search for other users and hashtags to find relevant content.
Overall, this Twitter clone application uses Spring Boot, Java, and React in an exciting way to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.
